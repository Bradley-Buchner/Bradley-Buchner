👋 Hi! I'm Bradley, a UNC-Chapel Hill and Northeastern trained computational bioengineer interested in all things AI and biology. As a lab research assistant at Northeastern University, I apply methods in deep learning to study the genetics of aging.
- 🧬 I'm currently working on SynergyGT: a graph transformer model for predicting pairs of gene perturbations that synergistically alter lifespan in the roundworm *C. elegans*.
- 🤖 I recently worked on augmenting INDRA: an automated knowledge assembly system for molecular biology.
- 🏀 Ask me about my love for UNC Basketball or my admittedly pretentious appreciation of craft beer! You can reach me at bradleybuchner1@gmail.com.
