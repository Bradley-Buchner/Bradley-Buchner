# Bradley Buchner's Portfolio

## About Me
I am a recent graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill where I earned my degree in Statistics and Analytics and worked as a data analyst for the UNC Baseball team. Holding the position of UNC Baseball's Director of Analytics from 2021 to 2023, I led a team of 25-30 student analysts and worked closely with coaching staff and players to push data-driven initiatives. Following graduation I spent 3 months with the Chicago Cubs as an intern in their Baseball Sciences group where I researched hitting biomechanics. My primary interest is using machine learning and motion capture data to study the science behind hitting performance and integrate this into an organization's hitting development.

## Experience
My professional experience consists of 5 years of working with data in baseball that includes front office experience with the Chicago Cubs, 2 years leading UNC Baseball's R&D initiatives, and 2 summer internships with USA Baseball. More details about my work experience can be found in my resume below.
