👋 Hi! I'm Bradley, a UNC-Chapel Hill and Northeastern trained computational bioengineer interested in all things AI and biology. As a lab research assistant at Northeastern University, I apply methods in deep learning to study the genetics of aging.

Lately, I've been...
- 🧬 [building SynergyGT](https://github.com/Bradley-Buchner/worm_synergy): a graph transformer model for predicting pairs of gene perturbations that synergistically alter lifespan in the roundworm *C. elegans*.
- 🤖 [contributing to INDRA](https://github.com/gyorilab/indra): an automated knowledge assembly system for molecular biology.
- 🕸️ [working with *Mutual Interactors*](https://github.com/Bradley-Buchner/milieu_worm): a network-based machine learning framework for predicting phenotype associations in molecular networks.

🏀 Ask me about my love for UNC Basketball or my admittedly pretentious appreciation of craft beer! You can reach me at bradleybuchner1@gmail.com.
