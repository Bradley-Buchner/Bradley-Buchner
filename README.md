# Bradley Buchner's Portfolio

## About Me
I am a recent graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill, where I earned my degree in Statistics and Analytics and worked as a data analyst for the UNC Baseball team. Holding the position of UNC Baseball's Director of Analytics from 2021 to 2023, I led a team of 25-30 student analysts and worked closely with coaching staff and players to push data-driven initiatives. Following graduation, I spent 3 months with the Chicago Cubs as an intern in their Baseball Sciences group, where I augmented the organization's assessment of an athlete's biomechanics with a machine learning model. My primary interests are in applied machine learning, deep learning, and human movement.

## Experience
My professional experience consists of 4 years of working as a data analyst that includes front office experience with the Chicago Cubs, 4 years with UNC Baseball (2 of them as Director of Analytics), and 2 summer internships with USA Baseball. More details about my work experience can be found in my resume below.
