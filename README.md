# Bradley Buchner's Portfolio

## About Me
I am a recent graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill where I earned my degree in Statistics and Analytics and worked as a data analyst for the UNC Baseball team. Holding the position of UNC Baseball's Director of Analytics from 2021 to 2023, I led a team of 25-30 student analysts and worked closely with coaching staff and players to push data-driven initiatives. My primary interest is studying the science behind hitting performance with motion capture data and integrating this into an organization's hitting development.

## Experience
My professional experience consists of 5 years of working with data in baseball. I recently completed an internship with the Chicago Cubs as member of their Baseball Sciences group, worked 4 years with UNC Baseball and have had 2 internships with USA Baseball. More details about my work experience can be found in my resume below.
