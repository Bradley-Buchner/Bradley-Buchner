# Bradley Buchner's Portfolio

## About Me
In May of 2023 I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill, where I earned my BS in Statistics and Analytics and spent four years as a data analyst for the UNC Baseball team. For two years, I held the position of Director of Analytics for UNC Baseball, leading a team of 25-30 student analysts and working closely with coaching staff and players to push data-driven initiatives. Following graduation, I spent 3 months with the Chicago Cubs as an intern in their Baseball Sciences group, where I augmented the organization's assessment of athlete biomechanics with a machine learning model. My primary interests are in applied machine learning, deep learning, and human movement.
